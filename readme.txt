NEURON files from the paper:

Using Strahler’s analysis to reduce up to 200-fold the run time 
of realistic neuron models, by A. Marasco, A.Limongiello, and M.Migliore
(2013) Sci. Rep. 3, 2934; DOI:10.1038/srep02934 (in press).


Usage:

Compile the mod files and run RedPurk.hoc for the main simulation

The simulation file allows to play with the different morphologies used in the paper.

Example run: After the simulation starts press the "Run the Full &
Reduced Models" button, then select e4cb3a1.hoc in the morphologies
folder. The simulation will reproduce the traces in Fig.2D (left) of
the paper (where the last 1000 ms are shown). 

Note: pj.mod updated to be valid for 9.0 nad legacy NEURON versions.
